# autosys---jil2xlsx
Simple python script that takes jil output from the command autorep -j * -q and parse it into Excel file. Useful if you do not have deep knowledge into Autosys and want to change some parameters. Afterwards you can use my other script (xls2jil.py) to make again JIL file with the changes you made in the Excel file.
